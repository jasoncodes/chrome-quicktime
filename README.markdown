# Play in QuickTime (Google Chrome Extension)
## Opens audio/video files (H.264, AAC, etc) in QuickTime Player.

Do you find in browser video playback to be limiting? High CPU usage, bad scaling and no full screen support getting you down?

With this extension anytime you click on a H.264 video file it will open right up in QuickTime Player where you can play hardware accelerated video fullscreen.
